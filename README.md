# Inventory-management

I am building this project for my dad's shop 
- Aim is to develop inventory management software that has fast search, billing, etc...
- Will use React in the frontend and mostly python in the backend.
- Things to do :
    - start from user stories 
    - create all use cases
    - once initial requirements are done start with the project
    - In the future 
        - see how can this be made a desktop application using react native or electron
